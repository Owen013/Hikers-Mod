# Hiker's Mod
The aim of this mod is to make the player move around more intuitively. All features of the mod are individually toggleable, so you can disable features if you don't like them.

# Tap-to-Jump
Normally in Outer Wilds, you have to hold space to charge a jump and then release space to perform the jump. The tap-to-jump feature, which is enabled by default, removes having to charge your jump so that the player will jump immediately once you press space. In my experience, this makes the player feel much more responsive!

# No Strafing-Slowdown
In vanilla Outer Wilds, the player walks slightly slower if they aren't walking directly forward. The "no strafe-slowdown" feature, which is also enabled by default, removes this slowdown so that you can move full-speed ahead even to the right, left, or behind!

# Sprinting
The sprinting feature (which is enabled by default) allows you to run faster if you hold the thrust-down button while moving!

# Climbing
This feature is **disabled** by default, but if you enable it you can climb up walls by pressing the jump button while facing a wall.

# Modify your movement speed, jump height, and more
Hiker's Mod allows you to change your character's running, walking, and sprinting speeds and your jump height so that you can make the hatchling as acrobatic as you please!
