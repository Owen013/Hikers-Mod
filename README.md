# Hiker's Mod
### Instant Jump
No longer do you have to hold down the button before you jump! With this enabled, you will immediately jump upon pressing the jump button.

### Enhanced Air Control
Makes you slightly more maneuverable in midair without your jetpack! Allows you to change speed and direction in midair.

### Sprinting
You've got 22 minutes, so get a move on! Move faster by holding down the sprint key, which can be bound to the thrust-up or thrust-down button! Carefully designed to work with the jetpack controls and to avoid cheese.

### Emergency Boost
For those tough situations where you need a quick burst of upward movement! Press space twice in quick succession (while not holding the up- or downward thrust buttons) to shoot up into the air, but be wary! It uses a lot of fuel.

### Modify your movement speed, jump height, and more
Change your speed, jump height, and more in the config menu!

### Floaty Physics
This feature makes your movement floatier on low-gravity bodies! The lower the gravity is, the lower your acceleration is, which means you'll take longer to reach your top speed.

### Wall-Jumping
Want to get up to the observatory quickly? Press space in midair while facing a wall to jump off of it, and repeat to climb up walls!

### Don't like it? Turn it off!
Any of Hiker's Mod's features can be enabled or disabled so that you can use the features that you want without being forced to use the ones that you don't like! Furthermore, not all features are enabled by default. Go to the config menu to enable/disable/customize Hiker's Mod features.
