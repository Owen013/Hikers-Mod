# Hiker's Mod
The aim of this mod is to make the player move around more intuitively. All features of the mod are individually toggleable, so you can disable features if you don't like them.

## Tap-to-Jump
Normally in Outer Wilds, you have to hold space to charge a jump and then release space to perform the jump. The tap-to-jump feature, which is enabled by default, removes having to charge your jump so that the player will jump immediately once you press space. In my experience, this makes the player feel much more responsive!

## No Strafing-Slowdown
In vanilla Outer Wilds, the player walks slightly slower if they aren't walking directly forward. The "no strafe-slowdown" feature, which is also enabled by default, removes this slowdown so that you can move full-speed ahead even to the right, left, or behind!

## Sprinting
The sprinting feature (which is enabled by default) allows you to run faster if you hold the thrust-down button while moving!

## Modify your movement speed, jump height, and more
Hiker's Mod allows you to change your character's running, walking, and sprinting speeds, your jump height, and your acceleration so that you can make the hatchling as acrobatic as you please!

# More features:
The following features are **disabled** by default, but they can be enabled in the config menu.
## Climbing
This feature allows you to climb up walls by pressing the jump button while facing a wall.

## Floaty Physics
This feature makes the player's movement floatier on low-gravity bodies! The lower the gravity is, the lower your acceleration is, which means you'll take longer to reach your top speed.
