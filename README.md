# Hiker's Mod
### Instant Jump
No longer do you have to hold down the button before you jump! With this enabled, you will immediately jump upon pressing the jump button.

### Enhanced Air Control
Makes you slightly more maneuverable in midair without your jetpack! Allows you to change speed and direction in midair.

### No Strafing Slowdown
Full speed ahead...even if you're not moving directly ahead! Allows you to move at full speed when moving backwards or to the side.

### Sprinting
The sprinting feature (which is enabled by default, unless you're dreaming) allows you to run faster! This feature is carefully designed to work with the jetpack controls! Your sprinting speed, which button you use to sprint, and more can be changed in the config menu.

### Modify your movement speed, jump height, and more
Hiker's Mod allows you to change your character's running, walking, and sprinting speeds, your jump height, and your acceleration so that you can make the hatchling as acrobatic as you please!

### Wall-Jumping
This feature allows you to climb up walls to an extent by pressing the jump button while facing a wall.

### Floaty Physics
This feature makes the player's movement floatier on low-gravity bodies! The lower the gravity is, the lower your acceleration is, which means you'll take longer to reach your top speed.

### Jetpack Super-Boost
This feature allows you to shoot upward with your jetpack when you double-tap the jump button. The downside to this is that you won't be able to use your jetpack's boost until you touch the ground again. Note: you can't boost while holding the thrust-up button.

### Don't like it? Turn it off!
Any of Hiker's Mod's features can be enabled or disabled so that you can use the features that you want without being forced to use the ones that you don't like! Furthermore, not all features are enabled by default. Go to the config menu to enable/disable/customize Hiker's Mod features.
