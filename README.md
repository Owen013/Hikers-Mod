# Hiker's Mod
### Instant Jump
No longer do you have to hold down the button before you jump! With this enabled, you will immediately jump upon pressing the jump button.

### Enhanced Air Control
Makes you slightly more maneuverable in midair without your jetpack! Allows you to change speed and direction in midair.

### Sprinting
Move faster by holding down the up-thrust button **while moving**. Doesn't conflict with jetpack controls; you will start thrusting if you press the button while standing still or press the boost button in midair.

### Emergency Boost
For those tough situations where you need a quick burst of upward movement! Press space twice in quick succession (while not holding the up- or downward thrust buttons) to shoot up into the air, but be wary! It uses a lot of fuel.

## Miscellaneous Features (Check Config)

### Modify your movement attributes
Change your speed, jump height, and more in the config menu!

### Floaty Physics
This feature makes your movement floatier on low-gravity bodies! The lower the gravity is, the lower your acceleration is, which means you'll take longer to reach your top speed. **Disabled by default.**

### Wall-Jumping
Want to get up to the observatory quickly? Press space in midair while facing a wall to jump off of it, and repeat to climb up walls! **Disabled by default.**

### Don't like it? Turn it off!
Any of Hiker's Mod's features can be enabled or disabled so that you can use the features that you want without being forced to use the ones that you don't like!
