# Hiker's Mod
### Instant Jump
No longer do you have to hold down the button before you jump! With this enabled, you will immediately jump upon pressing the jump button.

### Midair Turning
Allows you to slightly change course or slow down in midair without your jetpack. Has limited use, but feels good to have and would have saved me from falling to my death on my very first playthrough!

### Sprinting
Hold the vertical thrust button while moving to start sprinting. Hold the button while standing still to use your jetpack as normal.

### Emergency Boost
For those tough situations where you need a quick burst of upward movement. In midair, let go of your jetpack controls and press the jump button twice to shoot up into the air, but be wary! It uses a lot of fuel.

## Miscellaneous Features

### Modify your movement attributes
Change your speed, jump height, and more in the config menu.

### Floaty Physics
This feature makes your movement floatier on low-gravity bodies! The lower the gravity is, the lower your acceleration is, which means you'll take longer to reach your top speed. **Disabled by default.**

### Wall-Jumping
Scale short walls, no jetpack required! Press space in midair while facing a wall to jump off of it, and repeat to climb up walls. **Disabled by default.**

### Don't like it? Turn it off!
Any of Hiker's Mod's features can be enabled or disabled so that you can use the features that you want without being forced to use the ones that you don't like! Go to the config menu to customize your experience.
